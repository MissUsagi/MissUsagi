- 👋 Hi, I’m @MissUsagi
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, graphic design, photography. 
- 💞️ My tech stack: Vue, JS, HTML, CSS, TypeScript(basics), basic knowledge about React, and Three.js (because it is fun).

## ✨ What's Next:
I'm in the process of redesigning a **Kanji Learning App** using Nuxt and the Vue Composition API. My goal is to rewrite it in a "better way," including modern tools and practices to create a more efficient and scalable application. To achieve this, I'm also working on smaller projects, like a Vue.js **Aquarium app**, as a way to experiment with new ideas and sharpen my skills. These sandbox projects help me learn and apply best practices, which I can then bring into the Kanji app's development.

### 👀 Prototype -> Sneak peek of Kanji App:
